# Any 

The Any-Node can be used to check if there is any match within all entries. Other than the filter node or filter advanced node, the None-Exit is only filled, if there is no match at all. 

In case of any match you can decide if you want to receive all entries, just those that match the filter or just the first that matches the filter.
