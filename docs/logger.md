![Logo](./data/logos/logger.svg)


The logger node is meant to simplify the development process of nodes


# Inputs 

The input is the data that shall be logged


# Outputs

The Output just forwards the input data


# Example

When developing a workflow, it can be anoying to jump between nodes to debug single nodes or to jump between executions and the workflow setup.  

The Logger can log the data in form of a JSON or Table to the LogOutput of the Browser and to the logs of the server.

Additionally a description can be provided so that you could also just print a simple message.

Most of the other nodes examples make use of the Logger Node
