# n8n-advanced-flow-nodes

This is an n8n community node. It lets you do some advanced flows. The n8n default provides different flow nodes to switch, if or filter data. These nodes come with 2 disadvantages:

1. There is no possibility to get statistics
2. There is no possibility to check for any/none matches

These advanced flow nodes fix both these issues.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.
